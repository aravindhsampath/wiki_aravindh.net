## What goes into this wiki?

I write for myself, first. I write things I think I might need again.

It's mostly computer topics such as performance, unix commands, interesting notes etc.

## What is it made of?
[mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org) + [Material theme for mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

## Found a mistake?
Please write to aravindh@fastmail.com and I will fix it.
